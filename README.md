# Blood-cell-detection-using-supervised-learning
In this notebook you will find the sted by step method of how  to classsify the blood samples... using the supervised learning method..
and i have used pretrained model where it uses the fastai library.. and the model learning rate was 95.5%... and it can be used to detectt
